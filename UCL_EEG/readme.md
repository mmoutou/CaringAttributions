UCL_EEG will in the first instance contain behavioural - and in future possibly EEG - data. 
Every participant is coded by two consecutive numbers, e.g. 21 and 22, corresponging to the first and second sub-task.
Some will have the 'apples' version first, others will have the 'caring' version first. The sub-tasks are formatted identically.
